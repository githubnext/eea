# Extract, Edit, Apply

**Abstract**: Extract, Edit, Apply (EEA) is a new category of assists for software development that aims to streamline the process of using natural language for code modification over existing codebases. EEA revolves around the notion of _ephemeral_, _editable_ specifications: users can edit either the code, or edit ephemeral specs, which are code summaries pivoting on a user-specifiable topic. These specifications can be generated, modified, and discarded as needed. This report outlines the core idea, two of our prototypes of the concept, some observations of its utility, and describe possible future variations which could be developed.
